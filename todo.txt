things to do:

- see if I can modify fast.ai to allow for an imbalanced class weight in the loss function

- see about xgboost results with resampling
- see about XGBoost with augmentation of admission class

- research augmentation of tabular data

- research differentiable AUC like loss function

- use bert to the rescue notebook to create a classifer for subjective notes and medical hx
    - then use this to classify
- use fast.ai to retrain parallel tabular and nlp learners on same data, then mix results
